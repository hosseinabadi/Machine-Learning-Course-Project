## Description
Implemented a machine learning pipeline to predict whether or not customers will eventually purchase a product after clicking on its ad. The project consisted of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis(EDA), visualization, feature engineering, testing and tuning different models such as Wide and Deep Learning, Light GBM, Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier to choose the most accurate one and finally containerizing different parts with docker and made a pipeline of these containers so that the project could be deployed by users.
